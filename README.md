# Foo Commerce
Basic E-Commerce final project website for ASE-230. This is written in PHP. More will follow in the future.

This E-Commerce website has 3 types of users. 
- Visitors: which are unauthenticated regular browsers
- Users: Registered people on the commerce website
- Administrators: The people that manage the website to make it run smoothly for visitors and users

How to navigate foocommerce
1.)Everybody can access the home page, and specific product details pages. You can access home by using the nav bar, and you can access product details by clicking on the image of a specific product. 

2.)Administrators have access to the Admin tools page. When they are authenticated properly, they can access this page and choose to go to one of three places
- Create: Used for creating new categories and products
- Delete: Used for deleting new categories and products
- Modify: Used for modifying new categories and products
*Note: Two forms will appear on each of these pages. You can only use ONE of them at a time. For example, on create, you can't create a new category and a new product at once since both forms are separate from each other.

3.)Authenticated users will have access to their own orders page where they can edit their order. This works very similar to a cart on other ecommerce websites. ONLY authenticated users can use the "Add to Cart" button to update their order. 

4.)Finally, the categories page can be accessed by all users. This page is just a way to view products when they're more organzied.
